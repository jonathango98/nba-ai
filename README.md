# NBA AI 🏀🧠

NBA AI is a machine learning project that predicts the outcome of NBA games using historical player and team performance data. The goal is to build a reliable and interpretable model that can provide insights into game outcomes based on past trends.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This project is designed to be simple to set up and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-ai.git
cd nba-ai
python main.py  # Or your script name
```

*(Note: More detailed instructions may be added later as the project grows.)*

## 📦 Dependencies

This project uses the standard stack for PyTorch-based machine learning. To get started, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the base dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch pandas numpy
```

## 🧠 Features

- Predict NBA game outcomes using machine learning
- Leverages historical player and team stats
- Built with PyTorch and standard Python ML tools
- Easily extendable for more complex models or pipelines

## 📁 Project Structure (to be expanded)

- `player_raw.csv` — raw historical player performance data
- `team_raw.csv` — raw historical team performance data
- `main.py` — main training/prediction script (to be added)
- `README.md` — this file
